Sandy is a Flash 3D engine, available in 3 different version: AS2, AS3 and new haXe

# Sandy was easy and documented ! #
It had more than 50 tutorials with sources to help you create the most impressive 3D web application. Unfortunately the forum was taken down by spammers, and then the domain was hijacked by seo people, so tutorials are now only partially available through [web archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20130127022332/http://www.flashsandy.org/tutorials).
